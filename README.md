# Superheroes API Challenge

This project is an API that allows users to manage a list of superheroes, including their name, superpower, and a humility score (1 to 10). The API supports adding superheroes and retrieving them sorted by their humility score.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to create a simple yet effective API to simulate managing a collection of superheroes, each with unique powers and humility scores. It was built with a focus on simplicity, usability, and collaboration.

## Humility and Communication

It was a fun and engaging challenge! I might have gotten a bit too excited about the project, but I really enjoyed the process. As a huge Marvel fan, this task allowed me to combine my love for superheroes with my creativity. There were moments when I over-engineered some parts, but I enjoyed pushing my limits. 

## Team Player Attitude

If I were working with teammates, I would collaborate on improving the UI/UX design. 
I'd suggest creating a responsive multi-page list, with a maximum of 10 superheroes per page, to improve performance and usability. 
We could also integrate an AI-generated hero picture alongside each superhero. 
Additionally, we could enhance the project by integrating a database or Redis for better data management, and even adding superhero avatars and music for a fun user experience. 
Working in a team would allow us to bring together different skill sets to create an amazing product!

In a team setting, I would focus on maintaining clean code and encourage regular **code reviews** to ensure code quality. By breaking down tasks, we could take full advantage of our collective expertise to bring diverse perspectives into the product.


## Eagerness to Learn

If I had more time, I would dive deeper into Jest testing. 
I ran into a few challenges figuring out how to integrate Jest with ECMAScript modules in Node.js, which was a great learning opportunity. 
Solving problems like this is what I love most about being a developer, and I feel like I’ve grown a lot through this experience. There are also aspects like performance optimization and error handling that I’d love to explore further to improve the project.
